# Muon Collection
LabWindows/CVI program to detect muon decays in custom instrumentation.

The experiment consists of two scintillators in coincidence, with output passed through a hardware discriminator and then recorded via an NI DAQmx data acquisition card.

This program provides a GUI to that data collection process, providing the ability to calibrate the scintillators by providing a live readout of the number of excitations, or collect decays and save them to CSV files.
